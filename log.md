# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Round 1 Day 0: June 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created the basic structure of the project, worked on adding addititonals blueprints for the application.

**Thoughts:** It was a hard day!  I really thought a lot about organising project's structure. But, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Flask is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some interesting features.
